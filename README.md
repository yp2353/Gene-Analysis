## PROBLEM STATEMENT
We aim to create a predictive model for cancer transcriptome identification and
identify recurring patterns in the cancer genome through analysis and comparison in cancerous
cells vs. healthy cells. This could lower the number of genes needed to test to give an
accurate picture of a cancerous cell, decreasing cost and increasing testing efficiency.

## DATA SOURCE
We have 2 data sources: ENCODE Database of healthy patients: RNA-seq evaluation:
Transcriptome (https://www.encodeproject.org/search/?type=Annotation&annotation_type!=imputation&status=released), and Transcriptome Profiling data from the Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma
project at the GDC Data Portal (https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/projects/TCGA-LUSC). The former has transcriptomes of healthy patients, while the latter has transcriptomes of lung cancer patients.
